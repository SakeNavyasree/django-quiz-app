# django-quiz-app
This is a simple Django-based web application for a quiz app. The app allows a single user to take a quiz, answer multiple-choice questions, and view results. 

## Features:
1. Start a new quiz session.
2. Get a random multiple-choice question.
3. Submit an answer and track correct/incorrect submissions.
4. View the total number of questions answered and detailed results.

## Assumptions:
1. **One User Session**: Only one user can take the quiz at a time, and all sessions are independent.
2. **Questions Database**: The question set is pre-defined, and there is no API/UI for creating or adding questions. The questions are stored in the `Question` model in the database.
3. **Session Management**: The session ID is used to track the user's progress in the quiz.
4. **Random Question Selection**: The user will be presented with random questions from the database, and thereâ€™s no specific order to the questions.

## Requirements:
- Python 3.x
- Django 3.x or higher
- SQLite (default database, can be replaced with another DB like MySQL/PostgreSQL)
